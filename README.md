# [GAN-PYTORCH] Image Colorization with GANs using Pytorch
## Introdution
Here is my pytorch implementation of the model based on the paper Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004).<br>
The first row contains the grayscale images, the second row shows the images colorized by my model trained for 50 epochs, and the thrid rows presents the original color images.<br>
